# code+words / week 7

## + major project development

Here are a couple of sketches to show my (slow) development of my major project.

[First](https://celiamance.github.io/codewords/SKO/WEEK9/paragraph/) I just printed the paragraph on the screen.

Then I with help from Karen, we were able to get the split function to work in [this sketch](https://celiamance.github.io/codewords/SKO/WEEK9/paragraph2/)

Then I started working on implementing the random function, but I struggled to get it to work with the typing words effect, so I came up with [this temporary solution](https://celiamance.github.io/codewords/SKO/WEEK9/paragraph3/).

With help from Ray we got the typing effect to work properly in [this sketch](https://celiamance.github.io/codewords/SKO/WEEK9/paragraph_4/).
I'm now trying to work on adding a right side margin which is proving harder than I initally thought, and imputting the random function, which also doesn't seem to work easily!
