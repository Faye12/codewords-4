## + major project development

I decided to change my concept idea as I wasn't happy with my previous outcome. I thought that while it had potential for visual engagement, it was not related enough to words, but rather materiality of a text. So, I decided to explore a new quote from the same text, (this is an extended version that includes more of the paragraph it came from) 

'Precisely because a print book (usually) consists of planar surfaces bound in an unchanging order, it opens multiple possibilities for spatial organizations and numbering schemes that play with and against the linear page order, inviting the reader to reorganize the work by conceptualising it as multiple interpenetrating structures, each offering possibilities for interpretation different from the others. Although these structures occupy the same space, they organize it differently and thereby create mutating patterns of signification. Translated into a digital medium, V's line sequences reorganize yet again, using the flexibility offered by appearing and disappearing text to create a possibility-space even greater than the print book. When read alongside each other, a remarkably rich matrix in which to explore the varying dynamics of freedom and constraint produced/ performed by the durable marks and flickering signifiers.' 

I wanted to capitalise on the possibilities Hayles discusses in the digital format, ‘creating mutating patterns of signification’. By presenting the text in a mutated/ randomly appearing order the meaning of the text is altered and hence, changes interpretation. This manipulation references the freedom of the digital space to easily create infinite ‘spatial organizations’, each offering different possibilities for interpretation.

Here are a couple of sketches to show my (slow) development of my major project.

[First](https://celiamance.github.io/codewords/SKO/WEEK9/paragraph/) I just printed the paragraph on the screen.

Then I with help from Karen, we were able to get the split function to work in [this sketch](https://celiamance.github.io/codewords/SKO/WEEK9/paragraph2/)

Then I started working on implementing the random function, but I struggled to get it to work with the typing words effect, so I came up with [this temporary solution](https://celiamance.github.io/codewords/SKO/WEEK9/paragraph3/).

With help from Ray we got the typing effect to work properly in [this sketch](https://celiamance.github.io/codewords/SKO/WEEK9/paragraph_4/).
I'm now trying to work on adding a right side margin which is proving harder than I initally thought, and imputting the random function, which also doesn't seem to work easily!
